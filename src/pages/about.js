      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Runway is desktop application that allows to easily run state of the art machine learning models and use them in creative and interactive ways.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
      While commercial applications of machine learning can be found everywhere, experimentation of new prototypes and techniques remains - for the most- confined to computer scientists or engineers and has a limited reach to other fields.
      
      This project is an attempt to make machine learning models and ML related tools more accessible to artist, designers and anyone curious about this topic.</p>
